## ðŸš€ About the project

This project showcases my ability to build a complete fullstack CRUD application with a relational database.  
The backend provides a REST API for managing phones, including:
- Create
- Read
- Update
- Delete

and supports relations with another entity (brand).  
The frontend allows users to create, view, edit, and delete phones through a web interface.
